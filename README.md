# O2DS
Object Oriented Data Storage

      O2DS is a object oriented, flat file, data storage system.
      For every base type of data that your want to store
      (such as employees, posts, notes) you create a data UNIT.
      For each category or variation of your data, you create a
      data SLOT. The each slot points to its unit. Slots, not
      units have multiple functions for handling their data.
      Units have a couple functions for handling data but
      should often be left alone unless you want to make a
      strictly key/value pair based system (which is what a unit
       is). The O2DS project is completely open souce so knock
       yourself out!
