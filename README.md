# O2DS
Object Oriented Data Storage

      O2DS is a object oriented data storage system.
      In other words: a noSQL document-oriented database that 
      stores and recieves data as objects.
      For every base type of data that your want to store
      (such as employees, posts, notes) you create a data UNIT.
      For each category or variation of your data, you create a
      data SLOT. Each slot points to its unit. Slots, not
      units, have multiple functions for handling their data.
      Units have a couple functions for handling data but
      should often be left alone.
